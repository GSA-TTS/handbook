title: Operational initiatives and maintenance support
---

As a lean and learning organization, a variety of one-off tasks, special initiatives, and occasional maintenance chores bubble up all the time. Sometimes these tasks fit clearly within the scope of an existing staff role, other times they could be done by anyone with a bit of time.

Here are some of the mechanisms TTS has to do this kind of work:

| Resource | Helps with |
|----------|------------|
| [**\#TTS-help-wanted**](##help-wanted-slack-channel)  | **Short, fast, billable or non-billable tasks**  like writing review, graphic design, general volunteers |
| [**Operational initiatives and maintenance support**](/about-us/centers-of-excellence/operations/delivery-assurance/)  | **Recurring TTS-level ops tasks or improvements**  like processing agreements, outreach approvals, hiring actions |

## \#TTS-help-wanted Slack channel {##help-wanted-slack-channel}

TTS staff may request help from peers for a few hours of billable or non-billable work by posting to the {% slack_channel "help-wanted Slack" %} channel.

If your task is specifically for writing/editing help, use `@writing-editors` to ping the content designer group.

If the task is for a partner project, Tock to the appropriate engagement code.

## TTS Operations support services {#tts-operations-support-services}

The TTS Office of Operations is tasked with supporting business functions in the various TTS Delivery units including TTS CoE. They are organized into divisions including Acquisitions, Business Operations, and Outreach & Marketing.

For help with hiring, HR, benefits, finances, agreements, travel, coaching, etc, follow these steps:

1. Consult the main TTS Handbook. It is the primary source of information about support services and operational functions managed at the TTS level, including Talent, Business Ops, benefits, etc.
2. Ask your supervisor.
3. Reach out to your [support contact for TTS employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) for the specific service.

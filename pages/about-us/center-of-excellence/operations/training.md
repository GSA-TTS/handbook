After onboarding, TTS staff have various training obligations, some of which are mandatory. TTS also encourages staff to seek out and take advantage of professional development opportunities each year.

## Mandatory training

TTS and GSA require employees to complete annual recertification on a variety of topics. Required courses are conducted through GSAâ€™s [Online University](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/). See the [current list of mandatory trainings](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/training-and-development/mandatory-training).

Supervisors, CORs, and acquisition consultants may have additional mandatory training to complete.

## Other trainings

### TTS Consulting group trainings

Training themes across the organization are established annually. Staff work to bring in trainings to meet these needs. They are shared via email and Slack.

### Ad hoc group trainings

Groups within TTS can arrange for training to meet their specific needs. If training involves a cost, funding may be requested. Guidance TK.

### Individual professional development activities

If you want to attend a virtual or in-person training event, discuss it with your supervisor. Also consult the [guidance in the TTS Handbook]({% page "training-and-development/conferences-events-training/" %}).

OLU is also a source for optional training courses and professional development resources, such as books. Check out the [TTS Handbook page on development and training]({% page "training-and-development/" %}).

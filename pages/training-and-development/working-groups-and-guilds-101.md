TTS has a collection of communities that connect employees based on shared
interests.

These groups are a valued part of TTS (and in some cases, across government!).
They:

- Foster belonging through relationship-building.
- Provide learning and training opportunities.
- Help employees apply best practices and solve thorny issues.
- Encourage exposure to new thoughts and ideas.

## Working groups in TTS

A working group brings TTS employees together to investigate a particular
problem and achieve specific goals. They are usually self-organized and spin up
or down, depending on organizational needs. Some working groups are short-lived,
because the group has solved a problem it was formed for.

Working groups typically create Slack channels to coordinate efforts, and the
channels have a `wg-` prefix. Feel free to jump into any of these channels to
participate or ask questions.

The
[TTS Working Groups & Guilds Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com)
can help you find working group meeting times.

## Guilds in TTS

Guilds seek to implement long-term, positive change within TTS. They offer
training and promotion of best practices in their subject area. Guilds are typically long-running.

Guild Slack channels have a `g-` before the name. Like working groups, you do
not need permission to participate: just jump right in.

Guild meeting times can also be found on the
[TTS Working Groups & Guilds Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com).

### Guild leadership

Guilds should be led by people from different parts of TTS. They should expect
to spend a few hours per week on guild leadership, meetings, and preparation.
Individual guilds can set their own leadership terms, with the most common being
one year.

Guild leadership is recognized by a staff memberâ€™s supervisor as a
responsibility and they should be reviewed on their performance. However, it is
an informal role. There are no administrative supervisory duties attached and
there is no GS-level or previous leadership requirement.

Typically guilds follow a lightweight leadership selection process:

1. The guild asks for nominations via email and Slack posting. Guilds can choose
   to allow self-nomination only, or accept nominations by other people with
   confirmation of interest by the nominee. Nominees should have the verbal
   approval of their supervisor. Written nominations of no more than 400
   words are recommended; guilds choose nomination questions.
1. A panel of one-three people made up of guild leadership, other guild members
   and/or leadership from other guilds conduct brief (no more than 30 minute)
   interviews of candidates and make a selection.
1. A current guild leader announces the new leader, who takes up the position
   immediately.

## Communities of Practice across government

A Community of Practice (CoP) provides for government-wide knowledge-sharing.
They attract members from across government agencies, and provide a good
opportunity for Guilds to connect with others in government and influence best
practices beyond TTS.

Digital.gov
[hosts the Communities of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/).

## Organizing external (non-gov) speakers

At times, TTS groups may invite external speakers through their personal
networks. When inviting non-government employees, the event organizer must be
careful not to endorse any publication, product or service. This would give the
appearance of preferential treatment, about which the government has strict
policies. Speakers should also be kindly reminded not to endorse their product
by saying where it can be purchased or by offering discounts to government
employees.

TTS recently instituted a Request for Comment (RFC) process for TTS policies and
decisions that affect multiple parts of the organization. For employees, you can
[view the FEDRAMP community repository](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/) that houses all proposed
and approved RFCs as well as their respective discussions.

The following RFCs went through the discussion process and were ultimately
approved. They are listed in reverse chronological order.

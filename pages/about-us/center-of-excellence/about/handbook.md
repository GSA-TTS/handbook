The TTS Handbook establishes standard operating procedures (SOPs) for TTS and its offices. It sets expectations for managing our business, and delivering for our partners.

These SOPs represent how we think we can best achieve our mission. If the majority of our work follows these paved roads, it will improve delivery quality, client satisfaction, employee engagement, and the overall organizational durability.

## Governance process for the TTS Handbook

The TTS Handbook should be considered the source of truth for any TTS policy or procedure.

We need all staff to help keep the handbook up-to-date. If you find content that is incorrect, missing, or confusing, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/handbook/issues/new).

The TTS Chief of Staff is the handbook owner. They will review any suggested edits or additions on a rolling basis and direct a content review annually. All pages have a "Last modified date."

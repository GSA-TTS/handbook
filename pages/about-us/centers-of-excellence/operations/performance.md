title: Performance management
---

The performance management process sets expectations for what an employee should do day to day in their role and articulates how that work will be evaluated.

## Who is involved in performance management?

All employees. All TTS staff should have a performance plan and at least two performance reviews each fiscal year. Supervisors conduct performance reviews for each of their direct reports.

## How does performance management happen at TTS?

Consult the [general TTS guidance]({% page "performance-management/" %}) for an overview of the annual performance cycle and resources for supervisors.

For TTS-specific guidance about performance management, refer to:

## Trello decommission notice

GSA IT has decommissioned Trello across the agency effective September 1, 2025. After that date your Trello boards and cards will no longer be accessible. If you still have Trello artifacts you need to retain, export them now.

- Export format: use **JSON** to preserve full board content including comments; CSV exports do not include comments. Follow GSA IT's export instructions before your boards are removed.

GSA IT has not designated a single replacement product. Below are recommended alternatives to consider based on common uses of Trello:

- **GitHub Projects** — Advanced project and issue tracking for technical teams; Kanban boards, automation and developer workflow integration.
- **AppSheet Kanban** — Simple, visual Kanban app for teams who need drag-and-drop boards.
- **AppSheet Project Tracker** — Spreadsheet-style project tracker for timelines and status reporting.
- **Slack List** — Lightweight task lists inside Slack for teams that primarily collaborate in Slack.
- **Google Keep** — Quick notes and simple checklists across devices.
- **Google Tasks** — Basic to-do lists integrated with Gmail and Calendar for personal task tracking.

If you're unsure which tool to choose, discuss options with your team and account manager; consider data retention, records requirements, and partner access when picking a replacement.

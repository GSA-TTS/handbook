Brand management means presenting our organization consistently and professionally so that we can build and maintain a recognizable brand. A recognizable brand supports business and partnership development. {% comment %}TODO: Link "business and partnership development" to Engagements section.{% endcomment %}

It involves [our mission and values]({% page "about-us/center-of-excellence/about/mission/" %}), and design elements that reflect them.

title: Internal communications
---

TTS uses several practices and tools to support clear and frequent internal communication.

## Calendars

- [Google Calendar]({% page "tools/google-calendar" %}) is the primary way we indicate our availability and reserved time blocks.
- [The TTS Calendar](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag1kYDFRwB6qUilp?cmpsj=allRecords) in Airtable includes both TTS and CoE events.
  - You can subscribe to a [feed](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag0aA4Lrc6QZta3Q) that brings these into your Google Calendar.
- [The Federal holidays calendar](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag0aA4Lrc6QZta3Q) from OPM is handy too.

## Google Groups

[Google Groups]({% page "tools/google-groups/" %}) are used as email aliases for groups such as chapters.

TTS-specific groups of note:

- [All TTS staff](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/centers-of-excellence-Team)
- [TTS leadership](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/centers-of-excellence-Leadership)
- [All CoE staff](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/coe-leads)

  - All new engineering chapter members should be added by their supervisor. If for some reason you didn't get automatically added, give a shout in {% slack_channel "#dev" %} and someone there will get you set up.
  - This is a good way to write to the entire engineering leadership team at once.

## Slack

Slack is a primary communication space across TTS.

### Conduct and norms

- [TTS guidance]({% page "tools/slack/" %})

## Meetings

### Conduct and norms

See the handbook section on [interacting in meetings]({% page "about-us/centers-of-excellence/operations/conduct-and-norms/#interacting-in-meetings" %}).

### Scheduling meetings

When scheduling a meeting, include an agenda and a descriptive title. If an invitee’s attendance is optional, indicate this.

Aim to schedule meetings during the block of working hours shared across continental U.S. time zones. That block of time is:

- Eastern: 1 p.m–5 p.m.
- Central: 12 p.m.–4 p.m.
- Mountain: 11 a.m.–3 p.m
- Pacific: 10 a.m.–2 p.m.

### Meeting platforms

TTS’s primary meeting platforms are [Google Meet]({% page "tools/google-meet/" %}) and [Zoom]({% page "tools/zoom/" %}) (generally for larger meetings). Engagement partners may use other platforms, such as Microsoft Teams: see [using partners’ tools]({% page "general-information-and-resources/collaboration-tools/#using-partners-tools" %}).

### Recurring meetings

If you schedule recurring meetings for your engagement or other work, revisit them regularly and adjust their cadence and purpose as needed.

Several recurring meetings share information especially relevant to TTS staff:

| Meeting  | Attendees | Timing |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **TTS All Hands**<br> To share updates with all staff. Chat happens in the meeting chat and {% slack_channel "#townhall" %}.
